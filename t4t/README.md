Tit-for-tat (t4t) is a [game theory][wiki-game-theory] library with a focus on experimentation over
formal analysis, and expressiveness over performance. It provides flexible types and traits for
defining games and strategies, then executing them to observe the results.

The companion crate [t4t-games][games-crate] provides some example games and strategies.

See the [top-level crate documentation][t4t-docs] for more details.
