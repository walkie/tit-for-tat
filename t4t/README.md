Tit-for-tat (t4t) is a [game theory][wiki-game-theory] library with a focus on experimentation over
formal analysis, and expressiveness over performance. It provides flexible types and traits for
defining games and strategies, then executing them to observe the results.


## Examples and documentation

- See the [crate documentation on docs.rs][t4t-docs] for documentation and code examples.
- The companion crate [t4t-games][games-crate] provides games and strategies implemented with this
  crate.
