# Tit-for-tat: a game theory toolbox in Rust

Tit-for-tat (t4t) is a [game theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) library with a
focus on experimentation over formal analysis, and expressiveness over performance. It supports
defining games and strategies, then executing them repeatedly in order to collect and observe the
results.
