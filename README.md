Tit-for-tat (t4t) is a [game theory][wiki-game-theory] library with a focus on experimentation over
formal analysis, and expressiveness over performance. It provides flexible types and traits for
defining games and strategies, then executing them to observe the results.

This repository hosts two crates:

- **[t4t][t4t-crates]:** The library itself.
- **[t4t-games][games-crates]:** A collection of games and strategies implemented using t4t.

If you use this library for something, or are considering using it, I'd love to hear about it!
